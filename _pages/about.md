Hey there! We are the Society of Women in Computing which is our name for the ACM-W chapter at the College of William & Mary.

ACM-W supports, celebrates, and advocates for the full engagement of women in all aspects of the computing field. ACM-W provides a wide range of programs and services to ACM members and works to advance the contributions of women in tech in the community at large.

The Society of Women in computing aims to meet the goals of ACM-W and seeks to bridge the gender gap in computing-related fields. We also seek to act as a central organization for women at the college to provide resources and opportunities for women to network, foster relationships and share their experiences in computing.
