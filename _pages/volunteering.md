Our volunteering program at Berkeley Middle School has been a key part of our club since January 2018. We have been fortunate enough to receive two [ACM Student Chapter Excellence Awards](https://www.acm.org/chapters/student-chapter-excellence-awards/past-winners/past-winners) for Outstanding Community Service in 2017-18 and 2018-19.
