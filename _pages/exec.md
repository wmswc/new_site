  Hi! I am a senior majoring in computer science and psychology. I love being a part of the SWC community because it’s so supportive and it’s where I’ve met many of my friends in the tech industry :)

  My name is Em Ebalo (any pronouns). I’m a junior double majoring in Public Policy and Data Science. I’m also involved with the Filipino American Student Association and Minorities Against the Climate Crisis. I’m excited for SWC’s workshops. They’re incredibly helpful and gives you a chance to meet other wonderful motivated people on campus!

  I’m a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Physics. I play softball and have a brown belt in Judo, I’m also a member of WISE (Women in STEM) and the president of the brand new Judo Club. I love SWC because of the opportunity it provides to meet other women in CS and learn the softer side of the industry (how to interview, networking, internships, etc) as well as the support the club provides for underrepresented groups in CS.
