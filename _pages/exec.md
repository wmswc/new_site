  Hey! I am a junior majoring in computer science and cams on the math bio track. I am also a part of Chi O and SASA! I joined SWC my freshman year because I wanted to make friends that were in cs or data science and I also wanted to learn more about the cs opportunities that WM provided for me!

  I’m a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Physics. I play softball and have a brown belt in Judo, I’m also a member of WISE (Women in STEM) and the president of the brand new Judo Club. I love SWC because of the opportunity it provides to meet other women in CS and learn the softer side of the industry (how to interview, networking, internships, etc) as well as the support the club provides for underrepresented groups in CS.

  Hi! I'm a sophomore double majoring in computer science and math. I joined SWC because I wanted to connect with other female students interested in computer science. Being part of SWC has also allowed me to learn and grow from other students' experiences.
